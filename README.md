Hi, I'm @SamuelFrederick, and I'm a Ph.D. candidate in political science at Columbia University, studying American politics. 

My main research interests are polarization, partisanship, and political methodology. 
Specifically, I am interested in using machine learning, natural language processing, and social media data to better understand American polarization. 

My dissertation focuses on affective polarization and political representation.
